## Welcome to Athenars!

Athenars is all about *data-driven smart home automation*. We want a *loosely coupled, event driven* architecture and we want *reliable* and *responsive* systems. We want our system to be *local* and *open source*.

At Athenars we are building small, reliable and responsive modular services that provide those features described in the opening paragraph above. These will all be open source and are intended to be run locally on your own network. The messaging architecture of choice is MQTT. Our programming language of choice is Rust.
