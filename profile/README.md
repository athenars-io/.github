## Welcome to Athenars!

Athenars is all about *data-driven smart home automation*. We want a *loosely coupled, event driven* architecture and we want *reliable* and *responsive* systems. We want our system to be *local* and *open source*.

At Athenars we are building small, reliable and responsive modular services that provide those features described in the opening paragraph above. These will all be open source and are intended to be run locally on your own network. The messaging architecture of choice is MQTT. Our programming language of choice is Rust. Our database of choice is *Timescaledb*, which is a mature, high performance timeseries database built on top of Postgresql.

While this Athenars Github organisation is new, we are not yet considering pull requests. However, feel free to raise issues that may consist of suggestions or requests. Athenars is developed in the open and the various repositories are developed according the issues in the [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/athenars-io/projects) section.

Currently, the main development focus is the [RusQTTbom](https://github.com/athenars-io/rusqttbom) repo. You can also view the [Project planning here](https://github.com/orgs/athenars-io/projects/1/views/2).
